Hi,

Please go through the instructions:-

1. It can run on any machine that has chrome.
2. Thread.Sleep is added  purposefully for validation by human eye while test case is executed.
3. Please note that the slider value I couldn't set it to 820 max I have reached is 816.
4. It can be modified further like running validation in backend or running on browser decided by input directly.
5. If you find the test case giving incorrect answer please re-run the program(Due to some flakiness ).
6. POM and Page Factory is used for initialization and abstraction.
7.At the end validations we need to make the count of money to 820 to get desired
        results and same has been done at end.
